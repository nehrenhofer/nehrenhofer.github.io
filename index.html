            <h3>Post-Mortem Li-Ion Cell Teardown Lab</h3>
            <p>During my time at John Deere, I worked to create a lab capable of safely tearing down Li-Ion cells and examining their components. This lab was critical for cell supplier selection, failure analysis, and validating simulation models. 
                In developing the lab I learned to manage a corporate project while maintaining a $300K budget, a tight timeline, and communicating technical requirements to suppliers. </p>

            <h3>600V FSAE Electric Battery Pack</h3>
            <img src="img/IFE_600V_Pack_2023.jpg" alt="Illimi Electric Motorsports 2024 BEV" class="horizontal">
            <h4><a href="https://www.illiniformulaelectric.com/car/zephyr">Illini Formula Electric</a></h4>
            <p>In college, I spent a lot of time outside of class at the Engineering Student Project Lab at the University of Illinois. There I worked to design, manufacture, and test a fully electric Formula style racecar. 
                During my senior year, I worked to transition the team to a 600V 8.5kW High Voltage pack. This geometry offered huge thermal and power benefits over the previous 400V system. 
                At competition, the pack passed inspection with flying colors and proved to be a major upgrade for the next two seasons. </p>

            <h3>AWD Torque Vecotring Go-Kart "Sheila" </h3>
            <img src="img/IFE_4WD_GoKart_Shiela_2022.jpg" alt="Illimi Formula Electric Go-Kart 2022" class="horizontal"> 
            <p>One of my favorite projects during my time at Illini Formula Electric was the development of an All-Wheel-Drive electric Go-Kart.
                Given the supply-change issues related to COVID-19 during the 2021-2022 Formula SAE season, our Inverter and Motor setup
                did not arrive until less than 90 days before competition. Therefore, in order to offer the Software team a hardware setup to test 
                their Torque Vecotring algorithim, the Go-Kart "Sheila" was commissioned at the start of 2022. Featuring 2, 50V dual inverters and 
                modified RC Airplane motors at each corner, the software team was able to deploy their model from Simulink onto the Go-Kart prior to
                competition. While not fully representative of the formula electric vehicle, Sheila served a critical role in verifying the Torque
                Vecotring model. This model would be improved for use in future seasons.
